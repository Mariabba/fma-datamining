# Module 1 - Introduction, Imbalanced Learning and Anomaly Detection

1-Explore and prepare the dataset. You are allowed to take inspiration from the associated GitHub repository and figure out your personal research perspective (from choosing a subset of variables to the class to predict…). You are welcome in creating new variables and performing all the pre-processing steps the dataset needs.

2-Define one or more (simple) classification tasks and solve it with Decision Tree and KNN. You decide the target variable.

3-Identify the top 1% outliers: adopt at least three different methods from different families (e.g., density-based, angle-based… ) and compare the results. Deal with the outliers by removing them from the dataset or by treating the anomalous variables as missing values and employing replacement techniques. In this second case, you should check that the outliers are not outliers anymore. Justify your choices in every step.

4-Analyze the value distribution of the class to predict with respect to point 2; if it is unbalanced leave it as it is, otherwise turn the dataset into an imbalanced version (e.g., 96% - 4%, for binary classification). Then solve the classification task using the Decision Tree or the KNN by adopting various techniques of imbalanced learning.

5-Draw your conclusions about the techniques adopted in this analysis.
